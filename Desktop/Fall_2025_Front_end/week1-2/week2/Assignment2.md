# Challenge:

Create three variables:
A variable for a person's name.
A variable for their age.
A variable for whether they are a student (boolean).
Instructions:
Declare the variables with appropriate data types.
Assign values to these variables.
Log each variable's value and its data type to the console.



```js
//Create three variables:
//A variable for a person's name.
let myName="Moussa";

//A variable for their age.
let myAge=21;

//A variable for whether they are a student (boolean).****
let isStudent=true;
//Log each variable's value and its data type to the console.
console.log("Name:", myName, "| Type:", typeof myName);
console.log("Age:", myAge, "| Type:", typeof myAge);
console.log("Is Student:", isStudent, "| Type:", typeof isStudent);

```
